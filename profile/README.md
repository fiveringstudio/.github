# Five Ring Studios

Hey there, welcome to Five Ring Studios (5RS).
We’re a small team of friends, artists, and storytellers making things that actually mean something.
Games, animations, films, anything that lets us tell stories we care about.

We started this whole thing because we wanted to create worlds that hit on an emotional level.
Everything we make has pieces of us in it, our memories, our struggles, our sense of humor, and our love for what we do.

## Why We Create

We make things because we love the process not for views, fame, or money.
Our projects take time, care, and collaboration.
If something we make reaches even one person, that’s worth it to us.
